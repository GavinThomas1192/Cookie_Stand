        <p>All salmon used in our cookies were caught right here on the dock. One by one. Day by day we hire men and women to fish salmon straight out of the puget sound We use only wooden fishing poles to catch our salmon. We follow this sustainability
          straight into the kitchen. We have no waste, any garbage gets recycled into food that gets donated to the food Shelter. Anthing that can 't be recycled gets turned into awesome street art.</p>

          <p>Our cookies have won the "Most Amazing Fake Cookies" award for the past 7 years. I promise you won't be dissapointed. We even have to limit our customers to only one purchase per day due to customers gaining too much weight. Our cookies are
            the perfect blend of natural caught salmon and cookie. Our cookies are so moist you will most likely need a napkin. Even two.</p>
