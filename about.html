      <p>At Pat's Salmon Cookies family matters. This is why we give all of our employees an extra day off during the week but still pay them for it! Typically our employees only work four days a week so they can spend their fifth day off with family. We
        feel this promotes a healthy work enviroment for employees and customers alike.</p>
      <p id="paraTwo">
        At Pat's Salmon Cookies we also have a monthly "bring your family to work day" where we encourage our employees to bring in their entire family. Bring your family to work day happens on the last wednesday of every month. If you stop buy not only will
        you get to meet our employees families but all cookies are half priced!
